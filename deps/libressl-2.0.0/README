This package is the official portable version of LibreSSL
(http://www.libressl.org).

LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL developed by the OpenBSD project
(http://www.openbsd.org). LibreSSL is developed on OpenBSD. This
package then adds portability shims for other operating systems. 

Official release tarballs are available at your friendly neighborhood
OpenBSD mirror in directory LibreSSL, e.g.:
http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/
although it is suggested you use a mirror. 

Development is done in the upstream OpenBSD codebase.  A github clone
of the official repositories is kept at:
https://github.com/libressl-portable
We update this repository from the OpenBSD respositories
semi-frequently, so changes may not show up in GitHub immediately. 
The GitHub repository should be used for informational purposes
only.

./configure && make check && make install

See crypto/compat for the bulk of the local compatibility code. 

It will likely build on any reasonably modern version of Linux, Solaris,
or OSX with a sane compiler and C library.
